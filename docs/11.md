# Closures

```python
def log(program_name: str, message: str):
    print(program_name, message)
```

```python
x = 3
log("[pcap]", "Assigned 3 to x")
x += 1
log("[pcap]", "Assigned x+1 to x)
```


```python
y = 4
log("[cit]", "Assigned 4 to y")
z = 8
log("[cit]", "Assigned 8 to z")
```

```python
pcaplogger = create_logger("pcap")
x = 3
pcaplogger("Assigned x to 3") # [pcap] Assigned x to 3
x += 1
pcaplogger("Assigned x+1 to x") # [pcap] Assigned x+1 to x
```

## Closure

### Definition

A function that's nested inside another one.

This nested function has access the arguments that were passed in to the parent function. (closing over)

Allow us to store values in some context
even after those values shouldn't exist anymore.


## `.pyc files`

Python is an intepreter

It will read the code you wrote (the *source code*) and execute it.

There's an intermediate step between python **reading** the code and **executing** it.

Python translates/compiles your source code to **bytecode**, and it executes *that.*

### Reasons
- faster to read&understand
- cache code that hasn't changed
- smaller, easy to send & execute

When you run your python script,
Python will create a folder caled `__pycache__`. in here, it'll place the compiled bytecode files


# `assert`

`assert` raises `AssertionError` if some condition is `False`.
