# Exception handling (cont.)

```python
try:
    # some code that might fail
except ErrorName:
    # handle the error
except OtherError:
    # handle this one
except:
    # handle any error
else:
    # runs if nothing went wrong
finally:
    # Runs regardless of whether an error happened or not.
```

### Try branch

Always runs, up until an exception is raised.

### Except `ErrorName` branch

Runs if the `ErrorName` is the exception that
the `try` branch raised

### Empty Except branch

Run if some exception happened that you didn't
specify beforehand.

### Else branch

Runs if no exception was raised by the `try` branch

### Finally branch

Runs regardless of whether an error happened or not.

Used for "cleanup", such as file closing

# Custom exceptions

When we create our own exceptions,
we can't just `raise` automatically.

We have to say that our class
derives from an Exception.
