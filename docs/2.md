# Use cases for generators

* Lazy evaluation

Whenever we're working with streams of data, data that is either too big or too complicated to work with all at one time,
we can turn them into iterators/generators so our program uses less memory and is easier to understand.


# Iterator transformers

Describing the changes we're making to a stream of data

## map

Applies a function to every element in a stream

## filter

Plucks all the elements from a stream
that satisfy a "predicate,"
where a predicate is any function that returns a boolean

## reversed

Creates a new iterator
over some collection
that traverses it in reverse


## enumerate

Given an iterable (like a list),
it will create a new iterator
of tuples of length 2 (pairs).

The first element is the index,
the second element is the value itself.


# Anonymous/lambda functions

Python has a syntax for creating a function on the fly

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# regular function
def is_even(n: int) -> bool:
    return n % 2 == 0

map(is_even, lst)
```

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# lambda function
lambda n: n % 2 == 0

map(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, lst)
```


## Caveats

* They can only be a single expression
