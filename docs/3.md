# Parsing CSV files

We have two spreadsheets
represent our expenses for
the current year.

The first spreadsheet is the husband's
expenses, and the second spreadsheet
is the wife's expenses.

We want to merge these spreadsheets
together to create one spreadsheet
that has both of their expenses together.

## .csv format

Comma-separated values

CSVs are a way to convert a spreadsheet
into a form that makes it easy to process
for something like a Python script.


## Guidelines

We're going to be reading each spreadsheet
in from a file "a.csv", "b.csv"

And saving the result to a new file
like, "result.csv"

If there are any common rows,
we want to sum up the values in those rows.

If there are rows present in one spreadsheet
but not the other,
we want the resulting spreadsheet to
contain those rows.

Replace any empty cells with the float 0.00

Convert all decimal values to floats
