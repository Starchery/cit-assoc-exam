# Modules

## `__name__`

Returns the name of the module.

`__name__` is always `__main__` for code that's currently being
directly executed

The main module of our program, the one that's
expected to be run/executed directly

should always have the name `__main__`

We should check to make sure we're in `__main__`
before running our main code.

We don't want to run the main application code
if we're just being imported.

## `__file__`

Returns the name of the file
the current code lives inside.
