# String processing

## Caesar Cipher

---

### Problem

We need to communicate with our army
We need to be able to send messages like,

> 'The barbarians are coming'

Without letting them know, that we know.

We need a way to send messages
so that **only romans can read them.**

### Background

Encryption

Only the intended recipient can read the message

### Definition

Given a message, like `Hello, world` We're gonna rotate each letter one place to the right. Replace each letter with the letter that comes after it in the alphabet.

If the letter is 'Z', it would fall off the alphabet.
If we 'Z', we replace it with 'A'

> Hello, World

> Ifmmp, Xpsme

### Edge cases

Consider trying to convert the string "Zebra"

> Zebra

> Afcsb

## Addendum

Imagine if we had a **key**.

If I send you a message,
you shouldn't be able to read it
if you don't have the **key.**

We decide that the key for today is "hello"

I send you a message,
and you need that key to decrypt the message.

If you don't know the key, you can't decrypt.

## What is the key?

### Shift

> Hello (0 places)

> Ifmmp (1 place)

> Jgnnq (2 places)

> Khoor (3 places)

We want to shift each letter _any number of places_

So, if I decide that the key for today is 3,

then we have to shift every letter over 3 places
instead of 1.
